## Experience

### AI/ML Engineer, Arka (2023 - Present) - King of Prussia, PA  
- Secured $1M contract by delivering a path prediction algorithm that outperformed dead reckoning baselines in just 2 weeks, architecting a CPU-efficient probabilistic solution that ranked #1 among all competing teams
- Engineered few-shot similarity search system to identify patterns across 16M+ items using only 5 examples by implementing SimCLR self-supervised learning and optimizing Polars for 4B+ row processing
- Implemented multiple state-of-the-art NeRF research papers for novel view synthesis by adapting open-source models in PyTorch/Nerfstudio, successfully meeting all research milestones on time and under budget
- Enhanced machine learning model performance through implementation of heuristic labeling and sharpness aware minimization, improving F1 score from near-zero to 0.4 (CHECK THIS), enabling successful prediction of state changes and securing additional contract work
- Led agile transformation as Scrum Master for 6.5 months, implementing structured backlog grooming processes that increased sprint completion rates by 50%  (CHECK THIS) and reduced meeting overhead, while consistently delivering against program milestones





### Summer Intern, Lockheed Martin Space (2020, 2021, 2022) - Littleton, CO  
- Led ML-powered annotation pipeline development, creating automated polygon generation tools and data mining processes that increased team efficiency by 40% and saved 700 work hours in model training preparation
- Developed unsupervised anomaly detection system using KNN and Gaussian Mixture Models, processing data from 100+ temperature vacuum chamber devices to identify potential equipment failures
